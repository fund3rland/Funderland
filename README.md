Web3 fundraising made easy

This is a collaborative effort to guide the Web3 buidlers through fundraising either via equity, tokens or both. We recognize that there is no playbook for Web3 fundraising. As Web3 evolves, so should fundraising. We will work on providing a simple guide on the best way to raise for your startup. Whether you're launching a token or coin, raising from DAOs, VCs, or angel networks, this should cover it.

In the past years we have seen founders that kill their projects by giving away too many tokens/equity and eventually lose control of their company, investors who get rug-pulled and scammed, and communities that got sued because of breaching contracts. Our goal is to take away the best lessons, fix the broken parts and develop a community standard for Web3 fundraising.
